# AdServices developer tools

This repo contains developer tools for adtech developers integrating with the
adservices module on Android. This module aims to support the Privacy Sandbox
initiative.

The following tools are available:

*   adservices.py CLI for interacting with the adservices module, enabling and
    disabling the service, launching sample apps.
*   HostedTestServer: Dynamic test server which can be configured by a client.
*   Perfetto scripts and TraceConfig for profiling the FLEDGE auction.

## Feedback

The tools here are experimental, and we're looking to gather feedback from
adtech developers as we build them out.
